# Module 20

## Overview of the Analysis

This is a breakdown of the steps and purpose for Module 20 Assignment:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model - Overall Accuracy: 99%
  * Healthy Loans - Precision: 100% , Recall Scores: 99 %
  * High-Risk Loans - Precision: 85% , Recall Scores: 91 %
  * Analysis: 



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model - Overall Accuray: 99 %
  * Healthy Loans - Precision: 100 % , Recall Scores: 99 %
  * High-Risk Loans - Precision: 84 % , Recall Scores: 91 %
  * Analysis: 

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
