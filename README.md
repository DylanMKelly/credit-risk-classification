# Module 20

## Overview of the Analysis

This is a breakdown of the steps and purpose for Module 20 Assignment:

* The purpose of this assignment is to use machine learning to determine the cr4editworthiness of borrowers from an extracted data set
* Financial data is primarily based off of previous ussuage and spending history which will be used to determine the accuracy in predictions and the variables impacting it
* Used Value_count to help determine the difference between health cloans and that of risky loans
* MachineLearning and Logisitical Regission models were used to determine correlataion for te machine leanring and the differents results found from it
  
## Results

A breakdown of the results found between model 1 and model 2

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Overall Accuracy: 99%
  * Healthy Loans - Precision: 100% , Recall Scores: 99 %
  * High-Risk Loans - Precision: 85% , Recall Scores: 91 

* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Overall Accuray: 99 %
  * Healthy Loans - Precision: 100 % , Recall Scores: 99 %
  * High-Risk Loans - Precision: 84 % , Recall Scores: 91 %
 
## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Based off the findings between the two models I would go with Model 1 as it has a higher Prtecision rate with that of High-Risk Loans, as high-risk loans having a low precision it indicates that the the high risk loans for both models inability to read in complete precisioon would mean that the there is a fluctation in both models of above 12% which indicates a low risk/ high performing credit would not be read. For this reason I reccommend Model 1 for the best reading and results as the similar results mixed with the small difference would mean for the purpose of diiscission and secure spenditure, that model 1 is slightly more reliable/
